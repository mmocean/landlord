This project is related to game-dev && graphic-operation, but I have not done it. :)

Anyway, it's interesting, my final goal is to develop a console landlord game without any graphics library.

There are three main phases:
	1) draw some normal figures ( e.g. point, line, rectangle ) with ASCII in the console; (80%)
	2) achieve stand-alone game demo; (0%)
	3) achieve network interactive game; (0%)

This idea is so cool. :)
